Data from Admission Books of the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, PA

## About these Datasets
These datasets contain data from the three admission books held at the American Philosophical Society Library,  including inmate name, crime, sentence, place of origin, race/ethnicity, time in and time out, and comments on moral and educational condition. Some also include notes on previous convictions or progress made while incarcerated. A typical entry: "No. 58, Dec. 14, 1830. Saml Davis, Mulatto, Rape 12 yrs. Exceedingly excited, Enraged at the Judge & threatened revenge, Swore if knife or Pistol could be had, would revenge his wrongs upon his prosecutor also had sold himself to the Devil & meant to rush on to hell for revenge -- did not wish to hear of religion. Pardoned Nov. 21, 1842."

Double brackets ( [[ ]] ) are used to denote words that are not legible, or when there are other doubts about the text.

## What these datasets are not
This is not a replacement for viewing the original admission books. Care was taken to minimize mistakes and inconsistancies while creating these dataset, but it is being offered "as is". Despite the best efforts of all involved, mistakes often occur during the creation of datasets. Scholars are encouraged to consult the original records, in digital or physical format. Digitized versions are availble through the collection finding aid: http://amphilsoc.org/collections/view?docId=ead/Mss.365.P381p-ead.xml

## Credits
