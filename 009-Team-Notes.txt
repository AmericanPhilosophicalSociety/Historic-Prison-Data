Hi, guys -- just to let you know I am linked as a collaborator.  //Jim

--PV First visualization-- 
I did a visualization using the first app (Word Frequencies) to see which words were 
commonly used by the Moral Instructor to describe different groups of prisoners. I used
a combination of the word clouds, comparative frequencies plot, and keyword exploration 
to find the most interesting keywords for these groups. 
Comparing male and female prisoners, I can see that:
1. Words frequently used in the description of both groups are: hardened, stupid, attacked, 
mother (used in description of the inmate's family), religious (used in description of 
religious background)
2. Words more frequently associated with female inmates are: licentiousness, tears, repent,
shame, ill, husband (used in description of the inmate's husband), theft
3. Words more frequently associated with male inmates are: drink, tavern, mind, rob, arrested
(There are a lot of words but I just note down the interesting ones)
A limitation in the data is that there are a lot more entries of male inmates than entries of
female inmates, so it might be more difficult to make generalizations about female inmates.
This could be the reason why there are more outliers for female inmates
------

--PV Second visualization--
Continuing with the first app, I compared literate (able to read and write) and illiterate 
prisoners:
1. Words frequently used in the description of both groups are: drink, parents, evil, religious,
farmer
2. Words more frequently associated with literate inmates are pious, law, bible, associations,
admits
3. Words more frequently associated with illiterate inmates are stupid, ignorant, enmity, soul
For this visualization, I only used 2 out of 4 categories for literacy. An additional visualization 
that would be interesting to do is to incorporate 2 other categories (reads only, and reads other
languages) to see if there are any interesting differences from the two extremes

HK- I looked at App 3: Inmates by Length of Sentence
HK "App 3 allows the user to select a range of months via an interactive slider
 representing a sentencing length. The data utilized from the repo includes
 admissions books A, B and D. The data is viewable in app at the bottom of the
 page where inmate data is listed.

 "This application allows the user to switch between 3 different visualizations.
 One tab contains bar graphs displaying demographical data based on sentencing
 length. This visualization confused me at first because the y-axis is not labeled
 and I could not intuitively tell what the numbers represented. I think they represent
 number of inmates sentenced for the sentencing length in months selected vs.
 demographic categorizations.

 "The next visualization tab utilizes the moral instructors notes to create a word
 frequency visualization, the html formatting of which is difficult to read.
 Sometimes words are too small to make out or are cut off by the display box.
 Additional useful data to add to this tab would be; instead of listing admissions
 data below the word frequencies, if the specific note displaying the word in context
 and differentiating between moral instructors was visible below instead of just
 the admissions data.

 "Another visualization using the prison data that would be interesting might be
 a word frequency based on moral instructor, or based on demographic data. A user
 could then explore diction based on time period in which the sentencing was given,
 as well as what sort of words were used for demographic categories like male/female
 or age.

 "Data that would be interesting to add to the repo- admissions data past 1850
 between then and when the prison closed in the 1970's. Ability to distinguish
 data temporally might provide insight on the changing diction in sentencing notes
 during different decades. I.e. language before widespread use of motor vehicles
 on theft of horses vs. after vehicles are used widely."
