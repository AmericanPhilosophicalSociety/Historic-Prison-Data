Hi, guys -- just to let you know I am linked as a collaborator.  //Jim

HK- I looked at App 3: Inmates by Length of Sentence
HK "App 3 allows the user to select a range of months via an interactive slider
 representing a sentencing length. The data utilized from the repo includes
 admissions books A, B and D. The data is viewable in app at the bottom of the
 page where inmate data is listed.

 "This application allows the user to switch between 3 different visualizations.
 One tab contains bar graphs displaying demographical data based on sentencing
 length. This visualization confused me at first because the y-axis is not labeled
 and I could not intuitively tell what the numbers represented. I think they represent
 number of inmates sentenced for the sentencing length in months selected vs.
 demographic categorizations.

 "The next visualization tab utilizes the moral instructors notes to create a word
 frequency visualization, the html formatting of which is difficult to read.
 Sometimes words are too small to make out or are cut off by the display box.
 Additional useful data to add to this tab would be; instead of listing admissions
 data below the word frequencies, if the specific note displaying the word in context
 and differentiating between moral instructors was visible below instead of just
 the admissions data.

 "Another visualization using the prison data that would be interesting might be
 a word frequency based on moral instructor, or based on demographic data. A user
 could then explore diction based on time period in which the sentencing was given,
 as well as what sort of words were used for demographic categories like male/female
 or age.

 "Data that would be interesting to add to the repo- admissions data past 1850
 between then and when the prison closed in the 1970's. Ability to distinguish
 data temporally might provide insight on the changing diction in sentencing notes
 during different decades. I.e. language before widespread use of motor vehicles
 on theft of horses vs. after vehicles are used widely."
