Hi, guys -- just to let you know I am linked as a collaborator.  //Jim

I did a visualization using the first app (Word Frequencies) to see which words were 
commonly used by the Moral Instructor to describe different groups of prisoners. I used
a combination of the word clouds, comparative frequencies plot, and keyword exploration 
to find the most interesting keywords for both groups. 
Comparing male and female prisoners, I can see that:
1. Words frequently used in the description of both groups are: hardened, stupid, attacked, 
mother (used in description of the inmate's family), religious (used in description of 
religious background)
2. Words more frequently associated with female inmates are: licentiousness, tears, repent,
shame, ill, husband (used in description of the inmate's husband), theft
3. Words more frequently associated with male inmates are: drink, tavern, mind, rob, arrested
(There are a lot of words but I just note down the interesting ones)
A limitation in the data is that there are a lot more entries of male inmates than entries of
female inmates, so it might be more difficult to make generalizations about female inmates.
This could be the reason why there are more outliers for female inmates
